# Revolution R Open

This is the build system for Revolution R Open. It starts with the unmodified R-3.1.2 distribution, and incorporates the Revolution R Open modifications, and then builds executables on various platforms.

## To build Revolution R Open

### Windows:

```
git clone https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/RRO.git rro-win-build
cd rro-win-build/Windows
make.bat
```

### CentOS:

```
git clone https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/RRO.git rro-centos-build
cd rro-centos-build/CentOS
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

### Ubuntu:

```
git clone https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/RRO.git rro-ubuntu-build
cd rro-ubuntu-build/Ubuntu
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

### OSX:

The OSX build uses Travis CI's build environment (https://travis-ci.com/)

```
git clone https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/RRO.git rro-osx-build
cd rro-osx-build/OSX
chmod +x build-OSX.sh
./build-OSX.sh
```

### OpenSUSE:

```
git clone https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/RRO.git rro-openSUSE-build
cd rro-openSUSE-build/openSUSE
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

## Test Suite

To test the build, perform the following

1. build the test bundle

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/RRO.git R-test-bundle
  cd R-test-bundle/test-bundle
  chmod +x build.sh
  ./build.sh
  ```
2. Install RRO on the appropriate platform
3. Copy the test bundle `test.tar.gz`, to `lib` directory of R (i.e. `/usr/lib64/RRO-8.0/R-3.1.2/lib`)
4. Untar the test bundle in the `lib` directory of R
5. Run the tests from this github repository: `test/standardRTests.R` and `test/MKL_Benchmarks.R`


## About the Intel MKL


The Revolution R Open source tree is configured to allow building with the Intel 
Math Kernel Libraries, for which you will need the [Intel MKL developer kit.](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl)
If you have the MKL developer kit, refer to `build.sh` file for
the appropriate platform to configure the build to use the MKL libraries.

By default, Revolution R Open will build with the standard R BLAS/LAPACK libraries.
If you do not have the Intel MKL Developer Kit, you can still add the MKL to this 
build by downloading and installing the MKL Math Library from 
http://devstaging.mran.io/download/#download . Note that the MKL is not
open source software, and use of the MKL is subject to the End User License 
Agreement accompanying the download.

We have successfully tested RRO with Intel MKL on Windows and Linux platforms.
We do not recommend building with MKL on Mac, where the default build uses
the [Mac Accelerate Performance Framework](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man7/Accelerate.7.html) and has comparable performance to MKL builds.
