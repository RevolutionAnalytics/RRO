About Microsoft R Open (MRO)
-----------------------
Microsoft R Open builds on R 3.2.3 by making the following
additions and changes:

The default CRAN repository for this version of MRO is
http://mran.revolutionanalytics.com/snapshot/2016-01-01/.

Unlike a CRAN mirror, this is a static copy of CRAN,
created on 2016-01-01. Newer versions of packages will
not appear in this repository. To access newer versions of
packages, choose a CRAN mirror or use the checkpoint
package described below.

Microsoft R Open installs the `checkpoint` package. You 
can use the checkpoint package to access recent package
versions and to share reproducible R code with others. 
See https://mran.revolutionanalytics.com/package/checkpoint
for information about how to use the checkpoint package to
manage R package versions.
